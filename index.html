      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>General Information</h2>
      <p>My name is Collin Jones and I am a student at Madison Academic High School. I have brown hair, I'm 5'10 1/2", I weigh 140 lbs, and I'm 17 years old. I'm going into my senior year. I have very excellent <a href="academics.html">academic
          achievements</a> as well as extracurriculars. I have played soccer since I was a young child, and I am still playing today. I have started at right back for varsity all 3 years I've played highschool soccer. I also play for the Jackson
        Wolves, my local club soccer team. I have sustained multiple injuries while playing soccer; I have had 3 concussions, a torn ACL, and a lot of strained muscles. I have also been working on several <a href="projects.html">projects</a> while I
        have been in highschool, the most important of which was becoming a DevCatalyst finalist for a group website that my friend Adam and I made for the <a href="https://adambomb4550.github.io/Madison-Academic-High-School-Mens-Soccer/">Madison
          Academic Men's Soccer Team</a>. I am proud of all I have achieved in my recent history. </p>
