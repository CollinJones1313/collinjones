      <p>Well, my first favorite color is <a href="https://goo.gl/images/JCHGc9"> space blue</a>, no cap. I like it because my very first iphone case was that color and also because it reminds me of my 4th grade classroom. My second favorite color
        is probably like <a href="https://goo.gl/images/Nn1CPn">Periwinkle</a>. You know that cat off of Blue's Clues that was always super chill? Yeah that's why I like that color. My last favorite color is <a href="https://goo.gl/images/iY2jM1">electric
          blue</a> because I think it looks the best on a lot of sports cars, and who doesn't like sports cars, y'know?</p>
