      <p>My favorite project that I have made is the website Adam and I put together for the Madison Academic Men's Soccer Team, which you can view <a href="https://adambomb4550.github.io/Madison-Academic-High-School-Mens-Soccer/">here</a>. We did this in our Coding 1 class, which was taught by Coach Bucholz. We worked together on it all semester, and it turned out very well. </p>
